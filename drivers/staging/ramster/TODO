For this staging driver, RAMster duplicates code from fs/ocfs2/cluster
and from drivers/staging/zcache, then incorporates changes to the local
copy of the code.  Before RAMster can be promoted from staging, this code
duplication must be resolved.  Specifically, we will first need to work with
the ocfs2 maintainers to split out the ocfs2 core cluster code so that
it can be easily included by another subsystem, even if ocfs2 is not
configured, and also to merge the handful of functional changes required.
Second, the zcache and RAMster drivers should be either merged or reorganized
to separate out common code.
