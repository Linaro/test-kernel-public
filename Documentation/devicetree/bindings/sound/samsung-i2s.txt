* Samsung I2S controller

Required SoC Specific properties:

- compatible : "samsung,samsung-i2s"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- tx-dma-channel-secondary: The dma channel specifier for secondary tx
  operations. The format of the dma specifier depends on the dma
  controller.
- tx-dma-channel: The dma channel specifier for tx operations. The format of
  the dma specifier depends on the dma controller.
- rx-dma-channel: The dma channel specifier for rx operations. The format of
  the dma specifier depends on the dma controller.
- supports-6ch: If the Primary DAI has 5.1 Channel support, this flag is
  enabled.
- supports-rstclr: This flag should be set if I2S software reset bit control is
  required. When this flag is set I2S software reset bit will be enabled or
  disabled based on need.
- supports-secdai: If the I2S block has a secondary sound source support, then
  this flag is enabled.

Required Board Specific Properties:

- gpios: The gpio specifier for data out,data in, LRCLK, CDCLK and SCLK
  interface lines. The format of the gpio specifier depends on the gpio
  controller.
- idma-addr: Internal DMA register base address of the audio sub system(used in
  secondary sound source).

Aliases:

- All the I2S controller nodes should be represented in the aliases node using
  the following format 'i2s{n}' where n is a unique number for the alias.

Example:

- SoC Specific Portion:

i2s@03830000 {
	compatible = "samsung,samsung-i2s";
	reg = <0x03830000 0x100>;
	tx-dma-channel-secondary = <&pdma0 8>;
	tx-dma-channel = <&pdma0 10>;
	rx-dma-channel = <&pdma0 9>;
	supports-6ch;
	supports-rstclr;
	supports-secdai;
};

- Board Specific Portion:

i2s_0: i2s@03830000 {
	gpios = <&gpz 0 2 0 0>,
		<&gpz 1 2 0 0>,
		<&gpz 2 2 0 0>,
		<&gpz 3 2 0 0>,
		<&gpz 4 2 0 0>,
		<&gpz 5 2 0 0>,
		<&gpz 6 2 0 0>;
	idma-addr = <0x03000000>;
};
