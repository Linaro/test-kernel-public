* ARM CPUs binding description

The device tree allows to describe the layout of CPUs in a system through
the "cpus" node, which in turn contains a number of subnodes (ie "cpu")
defining properties for every cpu.

Bindings for CPU nodes follow the ePAPR standard, available from:

http://devicetree.org

For the ARM architecture every CPU node must contain the following property:

- reg : property defining the CPU MPIDR[23:0] register bits

Every cpu node is required to set its device_type to "cpu".

Example:

	cpus {
		#size-cells = <0>;
		#address-cells = <1>;

		CPU0: cpu@0x0 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			reg = <0x0>;
		};

		CPU1: cpu@0x1 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			reg = <0x1>;
		};

		CPU2: cpu@0x100 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			reg = <0x100>;
		};

		CPU3: cpu@0x101 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			reg = <0x101>;
		};
	};
