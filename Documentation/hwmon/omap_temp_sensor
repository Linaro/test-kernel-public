Description
-----------

The Texas Instruments OMAP4 family of chips have a bandgap temperature sensor.
The temperature sensor feature is used to convert the temperature of the device
into a decimal value coded on 10 bits. An internal ADC is used for conversion.
The recommended operating temperatures must be in the range -40 degree Celsius
to 123 degree celsius for standard conversion.
The thresholds are programmable and upon crossing the thresholds an interrupt
is generated. The OMAP temperature sensor has a programmable update rate in
milli seconds.
(Currently the driver programs a default of 2000 milliseconds).

The driver provides the common sysfs-interface for temperatures (see
Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface under Temperatures).
