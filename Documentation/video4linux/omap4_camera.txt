                              OMAP4 Camera Host Driver
                              ========================

Introduction
------------

The OMAP44XX family of chips contains the Imaging SubSystem (a.k.a. ISS),
Which contains several components that can be categorized in 3 big groups:

- Interfaces (2 Interfaces: CSI2-A & CSI2-B/CCP2)
- ISP (Image Signal Processor)
- SIMCOP (Still Image Coprocessor)

For more information, please look in [1] for latest version of:
	"OMAP4430 Multimedia Device Silicon Revision 2.x"

As of Revision L, the ISS is described in detail in section 8.

This host driver is supporting _only_ the CSI2-A interface for now.

Currently, it makes use of the Soc-Camera Subsystem, described in:
Documentation/video4linux/soc-camera.txt

Supports usage of MMAP buffers only (for now).

Tested platforms
----------------

- OMAP4430SDP, w/ ES2.1 GP & SEVM4430-CAM-V1-0 (Contains IMX060 & OV5640, in
  which only the last one is supported, outputting YUV422 frames).

- PandaBoard, Rev. A2, w/ OMAP4430 ES2.1 GP & OV adapter board, tested with
  following sensors:
  * OV3640
  * OV5640
  * OV5650

- Tested on mainline kernel:
